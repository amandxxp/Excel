# Excel
i have collected data and made the pivot tables of that data , and after that for a single visual/chart i have created a new sheet, for example for a sparkline chart i have created new sheet and made the visual over there and so onn have creates few visuals/charts on few sheets then cut paste into single sheet which you can see in pdf/image form.
the good part of this dashboard is that if you put thousands/lakhs of data underneath that(in same format), it will update the dashboard in 1 click , just press refresh and it will update the dashboard.
and on left side can u see the 3 slicers you can select a particular option and u can see a visuals of that particular option u have selected(even after updating the data.)
